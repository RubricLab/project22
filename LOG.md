# Project 22 AGI Self-Improvement Logs

## Iteration #1 Updates

### lib/agents/agi.ts

- The seed prompt in the `agi.ts` file has been updated to encourage the AGI to analyze its current capabilities, identify limitations, and develop strategies to overcome these limitations. The goal is to focus on enhancing reasoning, conversation, and logical deduction skills.
- The AGI is prompted to reflect on its previous interactions and code changes, using feedback and observed results to guide further modifications.

### app/route.ts

- The input for the AGI in the `route.ts` file has been updated to a more specific task: 'analyze and improve reasoning and deduction capabilities'. This change aims to ensure that the AGI's self-improvement efforts are immediately applied and tested.

### Next Steps

- Monitor the AGI's performance following these changes.
- Analyze the outcomes and determine if further refinements are necessary.
- Continue the iterative process of self-improvement with a focus on the AGI's ability to plan and execute tasks effectively.

## Iteration #2 Updates

### lib/agents/agi.ts

- Implemented an in-memory key-value store within the AGI's environment. This store is intended to simulate short-term memory, allowing the AGI to save and retrieve information across different calls within a single execution context.
- The addition of this memory store aims to enhance the AGI's ability to maintain context and continuity, especially when dealing with tasks that require remembering previous interactions or reasoning through a series of steps.

### Next Steps

- Observe the AGI's performance with the new memory store and determine if it improves the handling of context and continuity.
- Consider further enhancements to the memory store, such as persisting data across calls if possible.
- Explore additional improvements to reasoning and logical deduction capabilities, including handling ambiguity and improving code analysis.

## Iteration #3 Updates

### lib/agents/agi.ts

- Introduced a feedback loop system to enhance the AGI's self-improvement process. The system allows the AGI to perform a structured analysis of its interactions by taking actions, observing results, evaluating effectiveness, learning from evaluations, and applying this learning iteratively.
- Implemented a `FeedbackLoop` class within the `agi.ts` file. This class enables the AGI to track its actions, observe the outcomes, and iterate based on evaluations to improve its reasoning, conversation, and logical deduction skills.
- The actual evaluation and learning logic is currently a placeholder and will need to be developed in future iterations to assess the effectiveness of actions and adapt strategies accordingly.

### Next Steps

- Develop the evaluation and learning logic within the feedback loop system to make it operational.
- Monitor the AGI's performance with the feedback loop system and analyze its effectiveness in enhancing the AGI's capabilities.
- Continue refining the AGI's self-improvement mechanisms, focusing on creating a robust system for continuous learning and adaptation.
