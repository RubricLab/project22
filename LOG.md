- The AGI is prompted to reflect on its previous interactions and code changes, using feedback and observed results to guide further modifications.

### app/route.ts

- The input for the AGI in the `route.ts` file has been updated to a more specific task: 'analyze and improve reasoning and deduction capabilities'. This change aims to ensure that the AGI's self-improvement efforts are immediately applied and tested.

### Next Steps
