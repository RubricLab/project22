# Project 22 AGI Self-Improvement Logs

## Iteration #1 Updates

### lib/agents/agi.ts

- The seed prompt in the `agi.ts` file has been updated to encourage the AGI to analyze its current capabilities, identify limitations, and develop strategies to overcome these limitations. The goal is to focus on enhancing reasoning, conversation, and logical deduction skills.
- The AGI is prompted to reflect on its previous interactions and code changes, using feedback and observed results to guide further modifications.

### app/route.ts

- The input for the AGI in the `route.ts` file has been updated to a more specific task: 'analyze and improve reasoning and deduction capabilities'. This change aims to ensure that the AGI's self-improvement efforts are immediately applied and tested.

### Next Steps

- Monitor the AGI's performance following these changes.
- Analyze the outcomes and determine if further refinements are necessary.
- Continue the iterative process of self-improvement with a focus on the AGI's ability to plan and execute tasks effectively.

## Iteration #2 Updates

### lib/agents/agi.ts

- Implemented an in-memory key-value store within the AGI's environment. This store is intended to simulate short-term memory, allowing the AGI to save and retrieve information across different calls within a single execution context.
- The addition of this memory store aims to enhance the AGI's ability to maintain context and continuity, especially when dealing with tasks that require remembering previous interactions or reasoning through a series of steps.

### Next Steps

- Observe the AGI's performance with the new memory store and determine if it improves the handling of context and continuity.
- Consider further enhancements to the memory store, such as persisting data across calls if possible.
- Explore additional improvements to reasoning and logical deduction capabilities, including handling ambiguity and improving code analysis.
