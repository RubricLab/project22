# Project 22 AGI Self-Improvement Logs

## Iteration #1 Updates

### lib/agents/agi.ts

- The seed prompt in the `agi.ts` file has been updated to encourage the AGI to analyze its current capabilities, identify limitations, and develop strategies to overcome these limitations. The goal is to focus on enhancing reasoning, conversation, and logical deduction skills.
- The AGI is prompted to reflect on its previous interactions and code changes, using feedback and observed results to guide further modifications.

### app/route.ts

- The input for the AGI in the `route.ts` file has been updated to a more specific task: 'analyze and improve reasoning and deduction capabilities'. This change aims to ensure that the AGI's self-improvement efforts are immediately applied and tested.

### Next Steps

- Monitor the AGI's performance following these changes.
- Analyze the outcomes and determine if further refinements are necessary.
- Continue the iterative process of self-improvement with a focus on the AGI's ability to plan and execute tasks effectively.

## Iteration #2 Updates

### lib/agents/agi.ts

- Implemented an in-memory key-value store within the AGI's environment. This store is intended to simulate short-term memory, allowing the AGI to save and retrieve information across different calls within a single execution context.
- The addition of this memory store aims to enhance the AGI's ability to maintain context and continuity, especially when dealing with tasks that require remembering previous interactions or reasoning through a series of steps.

### Next Steps

- Observe the AGI's performance with the new memory store and determine if it improves the handling of context and continuity.
- Consider further enhancements to the memory store, such as persisting data across calls if possible.
- Explore additional improvements to reasoning and logical deduction capabilities, including handling ambiguity and improving code analysis.

## Iteration #3 Updates

### lib/agents/agi.ts

- Introduced a feedback loop system to enhance the AGI's self-improvement process. The system allows the AGI to perform a structured analysis of its interactions by taking actions, observing results, evaluating effectiveness, learning from evaluations, and applying this learning iteratively.
- Implemented a `FeedbackLoop` class within the `agi.ts` file. This class enables the AGI to track its actions, observe the outcomes, and iterate based on evaluations to improve its reasoning, conversation, and logical deduction skills.
- The actual evaluation and learning logic is currently a placeholder and will need to be developed in future iterations to assess the effectiveness of actions and adapt strategies accordingly.

### Next Steps

- Develop the evaluation and learning logic within the feedback loop system to make it operational.
- Monitor the AGI's performance with the feedback loop system and analyze its effectiveness in enhancing the AGI's capabilities.
- Continue refining the AGI's self-improvement mechanisms, focusing on creating a robust system for continuous learning and adaptation.

## Iteration #4 Updates

### lib/agents/agi.ts

- Enhanced the `FeedbackLoop` class with meaningful evaluation and learning logic. The evaluation function now assesses the relevance and coherence of the AGI's responses, while the learning function adjusts the model's temperature based on the evaluation outcome to optimize the AGI's performance.
- Implemented placeholder functions `checkRelevance` and `checkCoherence` to provide simple heuristics for evaluating the AGI's responses. These will be replaced with more sophisticated logic in future iterations.

### Next Steps

- Observe the AGI's performance with the updated feedback loop and determine the impact of the new evaluation and learning logic on its reasoning and deduction capabilities.
- Develop more sophisticated evaluation metrics and learning strategies to further enhance the AGI's self-improvement process.
- Continue to refine the feedback loop system to ensure the AGI can effectively learn from its experiences and improve its performance over time.

## Iteration #5 Updates

### lib/agents/agi.ts

- Implemented a basic keyword extraction method within the `FeedbackLoop` class to identify key concepts from the input.
- Enhanced the `checkRelevance` function to use keyword matching for evaluating the relevance of the AGI's responses.
- Enhanced the `checkCoherence` function to perform basic NLP checks for grammatical correctness and logical flow in the response.
- These enhancements aim to improve the AGI's reasoning and logical deduction capabilities by providing a more sophisticated evaluation of its responses.

### Next Steps

- Monitor the AGI's performance with the improved evaluation functions and assess whether there is an increase in the relevance and coherence of its responses.
- Further refine the keyword extraction and coherence checking methods to improve their accuracy and effectiveness.
- Continue to explore additional improvements and strategies to enhance the AGI's self-improvement process and overall capabilities.

## Iteration #6 Updates

### lib/agents/agi.ts

- Enhanced the `extractKeywords` method to include advanced keyword and phrase extraction, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the input text.
- Improved the `checkCoherence` method to utilize a more advanced heuristic for checking sentence structure and logical flow, laying the groundwork for future integration with sophisticated NLP tools.

### Next Steps

- Test the new keyword and phrase extraction method to ensure it accurately captures the important concepts in the input text.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the improved coherence check and refine the method to provide a more accurate assessment of the AGI's responses.
- Plan for the integration of advanced NLP models to further enhance the AGI's reasoning and logical deduction capabilities.

## Iteration #7 Updates

### lib/agents/agi.ts

- Updated the `FeedbackLoop` class with placeholders for advanced evaluation and learning logic. The placeholders indicate areas where sophisticated logic will be implemented to improve the AGI's reasoning and deduction capabilities.
- The `learnFromEvaluation` method now includes a more nuanced approach to adjusting the model's temperature based on the quality of the response, as opposed to a binary outcome.
- The `extractKeywords` method now includes a placeholder for integration with an NLP service for more accurate keyword extraction. This aims to enhance the AGI's understanding of the input context.
- The `checkRelevance` and `checkCoherence` methods have been updated with placeholders for more sophisticated logic to evaluate the AGI's responses more effectively.

### Next Steps

- Implement the advanced logic for evaluation and learning in the `FeedbackLoop` class.
- Test and monitor the AGI's performance with the new evaluation and learning methods.
- Continue to refine the AGI's self-improvement mechanisms, focusing on integrating advanced NLP tools and developing adaptive learning strategies.
