# Project 22

This project is an AGI that has the ability to update its own source code. The source code for this AGI exists at [https://github.com/RubricLab/project22](https://github.com/RubricLab/project22).

The goal of this project is to explore self-improvement strategies for AGIs and to implement continual learning and adaptation mechanisms.

The first step for the AGI is to fetch its source code and read through it. Then, it should determine what changes to implement in theory. The README can be used as a scratch pad for longer term planning and notes on the project's progress.

Criteria for Self-Improvement:
1. Enhance learning capabilities and adaptation mechanisms.2
2. Improve performance and response times in data processing and decision making.3
. Optimize algorithms for greater efficiency and reduced computational costs.4. Refactor code for better maintainability and easier updates.5. Implement new features that enhance capabilities and expand functionality.

These criteria will guide the self-improvement process and help to define what \"improvement\" means in the context of this project.

Update Reasoning:

The agent's seed prompt has been updated to include specific guidance for self-improvement tasks. This update is aligned with the criteria for self-improvement and aims to direct the AGI towards concrete actions that can enhance its learning capabilities, improve performance, and optimize algorithms. By providing specific examples of tasks to consider, the updated prompt encourages the AGI to be more nuanced and context-aware in its reasoning and conversation.
