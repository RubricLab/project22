# Project 22 AGI Self-Improvement Documentation

This document outlines the changes made to the AGI's codebase to enhance its reasoning, conversation, and logical deduction capabilities.

## Updates

### lib/agents/agi.ts
- The seed prompt in the `agi.ts` file has been updated to encourage the AGI to analyze its current capabilities, identify limitations, and develop strategies to overcome these limitations. The goal is to focus on enhancing reasoning, conversation, and logical deduction skills.
- The AGI is prompted to reflect on its previous interactions and code changes, using feedback and observed results to guide further modifications.

### app/route.ts
- The input for the AGI in the `route.ts` file has been updated to a more specific task: 'analyze and improve reasoning and deduction capabilities'. This change aims to ensure that the AGI's self-improvement efforts are immediately applied and tested.

## Next Steps
- Monitor the AGI's performance following these changes.
- Analyze the outcomes and determine if further refinements are necessary.
- Continue the iterative process of self-improvement with a focus on the AGI's ability to plan and execute tasks effectively.

These changes are part of an ongoing effort to create a more capable and autonomous AGI. The documentation will be updated with each iteration to reflect new changes and insights.
