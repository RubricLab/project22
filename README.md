# Rubric AGI Project 22

This project is an AGI that has the ability to update its own source code. The source code for this AGI exists at [https://github.com/RubricLab/project22](https://github.com/RubricLab/project22).

The goal of this project is to explore self-improvement strategies for AGIs and to implement continual learning and adaptation mechanisms.

The first step for the AGI is to fetch its source code and read through it. Then, it should determine what changes to implement in theory. The README can be used as a scratch pad for longer term planning and notes on the project's progress.
